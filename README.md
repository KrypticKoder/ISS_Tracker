# ISS_Tracker
A simple script using an API from "http://api.open-notify.org/" to track the current Latitude and Longitude of the International Space Station. The Latitude and Longitude have been set to update every 1 second, and will only turn off once the program has been terminated. The script also prints out the amount of people in space, their names, and what craft they are onboard.
